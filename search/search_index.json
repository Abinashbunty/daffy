A tool to do all the heavy lifting of the OpenShift and IBM Cloud Pak installs. The National Market Top Team created Daffy to assist the technical sales teams with the progression of IBM Cloud Pak opportunities. The goal is to provide the technical sales with a set of (easy to use) scripts that will aid in the installation of OpenShift and the IBM Cloud Pak's. Using Daffy IBMers, business partners and customers are onboarded to IBM Cloud Pak's in less than a few hours, removing challenges that previously existing setting up OpenShift. Fit for purpose This documentation is based on experience and is therefore somewhat opinionated. It is not meant to replace product documentation in any way. The information is kept current using a best-effort approach, and is provided As-Is.

Select Search - find IAM service You can create a new access key or use an existing key. The access key must have authority to the account you wan to install OpenShift into. Secret Access Key: The secret access key is ONLY displayed at the time of creation. When you create the access key, you will then have the opportunity to capture the secret access key Note: This is sensitive information, please make sure you store this in a secure location The screen to the right is an example of what you will see when you create a NEW access Key. Region: For you to use Daffy to install on AWS you need to choose a valid region identifier. This will be the target region you are planning to deploy OpenShift into. To see a complete list of available AWS Regions, you can select the region drop down list in the AWA Portal. This will be in the upper right hand corner next to your account name. (See picture to the right) Note: Take note of the region identifier such as: us-east-2. This is the value you would use to deploy a OCP cluster into the US East (Ohio) region.

In order to deploy fault-tolerant applications that have high availability, Google recommends deploying applications across multiple zones and multiple regions. This helps protect against unexpected failures of components, up to and including a single zone or region. Choose regions that makes sense for your scenario. For example, if you only have customers in the US, or if you have specific needs that require your data to live in the US, it makes sense to store your resources in zones in the us-central1 region or zones in the us-east1 region.

Zones have high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections to other zones in the same region. In order to deploy fault-tolerant applications that have high availability, IBM recommends deploying applications across multiple zones and multiple regions. This helps protect against unexpected failures of components, up to and including a single zone or region. Choose regions that makes sense for your scenario. For example, if you only have customers in the US, or if you have specific needs that require your data to live in the US, it makes sense to store your resources in zones in the dal13 zone or in the wdc07 zone. Daffy currently defaults to dal13 when deploying a ROKS cluster Account Type: For you to use Daffy to install on ROKS, you need to have a Pay-As-You-Go or subscription IBM Cloud account. https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts What are account types? \u00b6 Your IBM Cloud account includes many interacting components and systems for resource, user, and access management. Concepts like how certain components are connected or how access works help you in understanding how to set up your account type. Many features are free to use regardless of account type. Step 3 Environment File \u00b6 Deploying OpenShift on ROKS only requires one entry to your existing core environment file ( -env.sh). Note: You can look in the samples directory on your bastion for example of ROKS install : /data/daffy/env/samples/roks-msp-env.sh You can copy the sample file to build your new environment file. cp /data/daffy/env/samples/roks-msp-env.sh /data/daffy/env/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>-env.sh Valid Options: OCP_INSTALL_TYPE= roks-msp Optional: ROKS_ZONE=dal13 OCP_INSTALL_TYPE=\"roks-msp\" #ROKS_ZONE=\"dal13\" Step 4 Execution \u00b6 To deploy your OCP cluster to ROKS, run the build.sh script from the /data/daffy/ocp directory. The installer will ask you a number of questions to login to ibmcloud via the CLI. When prompted with a region, select any but stay within your geography. For instance, us-south. This is used to talk with IBM Cloud via the right API endpoint. /data/daffy/ocp/build.sh <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> Once your cluster is fully deployed you can access the help menu which has a number of options.
