## Domain Name System (DNS):

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, services, and other resources reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other functions as well.

- In a nutshell, its a system where your local computer can call other computers on the internet to translate a website name to a computer IP address.  Think of it as the internet phone book.

## DNS Registrar/Registry:

A domain name **registrar** is a company that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. A domain name registrar must be accredited by a generic top-level domain (gTLD) registry or a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry. A registrar operates in accordance with the guidelines of the designated domain name registries.

- In a nutshell, its a company where you can buy and register a website name.   Like **"mywebsite.com"** You would now own that name and can have that name redirected to any computer IP address.

A domain name **registry** is a database of all domain names and the associated registrant information in the top level domains of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet that enables third party entities to request administrative control of a domain name. Most registries operate on the top-level and second-level of the DNS.

- In a nutshell, its where website names are stored and has a mapping from name to IP Address.   Like **"www.mywebsite.com"** points to 169.45.45.55

## Enviornment Name/File:

You may see reference to **<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>**,  this is what you name your environment and the base name of the file to store your details for that environment.

Example  **gamm01**-env.sh is your file where **gamma01** is your **<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>**

Best practice, but not required, is to name your environment the same as your cluster as this is the core of your environment.

## Ingress Operator:

The Ingress Operator makes it possible for external clients to access your service by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers to handle routing. You can use the Ingress Operator to route traffic by specifying OpenShift Container Platform Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources. Configurations within the Ingress Controller, such as the ability to define endpointPublishingStrategy type and internal load balancing, provide ways to publish Ingress Controller endpoints.

- In a nutshell, it allows external access to your cluster and all the running pods/services/applications. Its basically an inbound router for your OpenShift Cluster.
